### Why does Test Pilot require a Firefox Account?

Test Pilot was launched with the requirement that particpants be logged into a Firefox Account.

As this is an evolving product, this requirement may be adjusted in the future, but some of the original basis for this requirement is

- We would like a way to inform participants in the future that new experiments are available.
- Test Pilot is about building a community through FxA enabled forums such as Discourse.
- We also use the account as a gate since we are doing certain metrics collections that we want to ensure people have knowingly elected to opt into.
