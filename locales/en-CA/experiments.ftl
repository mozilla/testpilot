cliqzDescription = Get search results faster. Cliqz shows suggestions right below the URL bar as you type. All while maintaining your privacy.
cliqzIntroduction = Get search results faster, directly in the browser. Start typing and see suggestions from around the Web in real time, right below the URL bar. And because Cliqz avoids collecting personally identifiable data, or building user profiles, your results are more private.
cliqzPrivacypreamble = The Cliqz Test Pilot experiment is brought to you through collaboration between Cliqz GmbH, and Mozilla. Cliqz is designed to protect your privacy and avoid collecting sensitive information that can be used to create user profiles. However, anonymizing data like this is difficult, and it may still be possible to identify specific individuals.

cliqzMeasurements1 = Cliqz GmbH collects telemetry analytics, including your interactions with specific fields and buttons in Cliqz. This data is tied to a unique identifier allowing Cliqz GmbH to understand performance over time.

containersIntroduction = Containers let you create profiles in Firefox for all of your online lives. Custom labels and colour-coded tabs help keep different activities — like online shopping, travel planning, or checking work email — separate. Because Containers store cookies separately, you can log into the same site with a different account in each Container, and online trackers can’t connect your browsing in one container to another. So you can keep your shopping self separate from your social self from your work self, without worrying about being followed around the Web.
