  <p>In addition to the <a href="/privacy">data</a> collected by all Test Pilot
    experiments, here are the key things you should know about what is happening
    when you use Universal Search:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We collect basic usage data regarding how you interact with the Awesome
      Bar (address bar), such as the number of characters typed, the types of
      results that you click, and their position in the results list.</li>
    <li>If you previously configured Firefox to display search suggestions in
      the Search Bar, installing Universal Search will enable <a
      href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/#searchsuggestions"
      target="_blank">search suggestions</a> in the Awesome Bar.</li>
    <li>When you use the Awesome Bar, we send the terms you type to our
      recommendation engine. We keep anonymous logs of popular searches to
      improve the quality of our recommendations.</li>
    <li>To provide Universal Search, we use a few third-party services. We use
      <a href="http://www.bing.com/developers/s/APIBasics.html"
      target="_blank">Bing</a> and <a
      href="https://developer.yahoo.com/boss/search/" target="_blank">Yahoo</a>
      to provide recommendations, and <a href="http://docs.embed.ly/docs/"
      target="_blank">Embedly</a> and <a href="https://clearbit.com/logo"
      target="_blank">Clearbit</a> to provide additional data (such as images or
      icons) about those recommendations. To display the recommendations in the
      Awesome Bar, Universal Search may download those images directly from
      Embedly and Clearbit, which may allow those services to see your IP address
      and the image requested.</li>

  <h3>Test Pilot Universal Search Retirement Report</h3>
  <p>Universal Search launched with Test Pilot in May 2016 and is the first experiment 
  we’ve formally retired. We designed it to get you to the best things on the Web faster, 
  by adding search suggestions and site recommendations into Awesome Bar results. We 
  think it did that. We also learned a lot in the process. That’s why we’re calling 
  Universal Search a success.</p>
  <p>Our basic question was “Would Firefox users find enough value in the recommended 
  sites to click on them in the Awesome Bar?” and we tested this and gathered feedback 
  in a few ways during the course of the experiment.</p>
  <p><strong>Here’s how it went down</strong></p>
  <p>At launch, we showed participants two types of recommendations based on their 
  queries: top-level domains (such as Facebook.com, Amazon.com, Youtube.com, etc), 
  and Wikipedia article pages.</p>
  <figure>

  <figcaption>Result displaying Wikipedia article.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>For the first two months, we showed recommendations when we thought they 
  would be relevant, about 20 percent of the time. During this period, we saw 
  that participants clicked on a displayed result about 10 percent of the time 
  (we call this a click-thru rate, or CTR).</p>
  <p>In July, we changed the experiment so that we didn’t display a recommendation 
  if the site was already in a participant’s browsing history.  We expected 
  this to dramatically reduce the frequency of results shown, and it did. 
  Results displayed fell from 20 percent to 7 percent. We were surprised to see 
  that our CTR fell, too.  From this, we hypothesized that duplicates we removed 
  included many sites that users visit habitually, so our initial CTR included many 
  clicks “stolen” from history navigation.<p>
  <p>In October 2016, we added a third result type, rich movie cards. We predicted 
  these would have a higher CTR than the other types, but discovered that while 
  rich movie cards outperformed Wikipedia, they did not outperform top-level domains.</p>
  <p><strong>Here’s what we learned</strong></p>
  <p>When we evaluate an experiment we look at usage data as well as what 
  participants tell us in post-experiment surveys. By both measures, Universal Search 
  was a success. In fact, it outperformed our expectations. We had surprisingly 
  high CTR for showing only three result types and overall user sentiment was quite positive.</p>
  <p><strong>Results from telemetry data</strong></p>
  <p>The data showed a final average CTR of 7 percent, and indicated a clear preference 
  for top-level domain results. A breakdown of clicks by result type showed that 
  Wikipedia pages were shown most and clicked least. Top-level domains were the 
  most consistent performer: our better relevancy on top-level domains (even 
  after de-duping) probably indicated we were short-cutting users to sites 
  they already knew they wanted to visit. Movie Cards had the least amount of test data, 
  but outperformed Wikipedia pages.</p>

  <p><strong>Results from participant feedback</strong></p>
  <p>The great thing about collecting feedback from participants is that we can learn 
  as much from our failures as our successes, and even a successful experiment is 
  not successful for everyone.</p>
  <p>Some participants who left the experiment in the first weeks mentioned performance 
  issues. Others told us they preferred separate search and Awesome Bars: their learned 
  habits were hard to overcome. Many who left also cited poor result quality: search 
  isn’t easy to get right, especially with a limited data set.</p>
  <p>However, some of the most telling, representative survey feedback came from users 
  who stayed. Universal Search had a high retention rate, and of the users who remained:</p>
  <ul><li>65% agreed that Universal Search results were meaningful, and</li>
  <li>60% agreed that Universal Search helped them complete tasks faster.</li></ul>

  <p><strong>Here’s what happens next</strong></p>
  <p>What’s next for Universal Search? Now that we’ve announced retirement plans 
  for this add-on, we will no longer maintain it.  If you have Universal Search enabled, 
  you don’t need to do anything. We’ll automatically uninstall it in the coming weeks.</p>
  <p>The experiment we built was not a complete product experience, but it was 
  enough to meet our learning goals. If we tried a similar experiment again, we’d 
  pursue better result relevancy and more diverse result types. We would also likely 
  test alternate UX treatments to see if we could affect interaction with results, or 
  improve user acceptance of the combined Awesome Bar for those users who preferred 
  separate URL and search bars. These are questions we may examine in future experiments.</p>
  <p>Thank you to all the Test Pilots who installed Universal Search, used it, and told 
  us what they thought!  We are grateful for your participation.</p>
