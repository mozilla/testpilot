      playing in the foreground while you browse.</li>

      video frame anywhere on your desktop.</li>
    <li><strong>Controls where you need them:</strong> Min Vid includes controls
      to let you pause/play, scrub, drag, minimize, and adjust volume right in the frame.</li>
    <li><strong>Now supporting audio playback:</strong> Min Vid now supports playback from
      SoundCloud and direct mp3 links.</li>
    <li><strong>Create a queue:</strong> Min Vid now supports queues, just start up
      a video and add tracks from any supported domains (YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, and
