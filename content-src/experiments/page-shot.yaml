    We store your shots on Mozilla's servers and will have access to those
    shots. However, we will only access your shots when reasonably necessary
    for the operation of the service, such as when someone sends us the link
    to a shot using our "flag" feature, or to diagnose any problems. We will
    also analyze all shots in the aggregate to help improve Page Shot, for
    example, by identifying the average size and number of shots taken by
    users.
  - >
    We collect usage data to help us understand your interactions with the
    product, such as the number of times you click the shots button, save an
    image, or encounter an error saving an image.
  - >
    To prevent abuse of this service, we do basic security monitoring. For
    example, we collect and retain IP addresses to detect and block individuals
    who are scanning the service to find private pages.
  - >
    For all visits to the Page Shot website, the data we collect is described
    in our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/websites/"
