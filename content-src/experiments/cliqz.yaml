introduction: >
  Get search results faster, directly in the browser. Start typing and see suggestions 
  from around the Web in real time, right below the URL bar. And because Cliqz avoids 
  collecting personally identifiable data, or building user profiles, your results are 
  more private.

  <p>
    The Cliqz Test Pilot experiment is brought to you through collaboration 
    between Cliqz GmbH, and Mozilla. Cliqz is designed to protect your privacy 
    and avoid collecting sensitive information that can be used to create user 
    profiles. However, anonymizing data like this is difficult, and it may 
    still be possible to identify specific individuals.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the <a href="/privacy">data</a> collected by all Test Pilot 
    experiments, here are the key things you should know about installing Cliqz:
  </p>
  <p>
    Cliqz GmbH collects data about your search and browsing activity, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Text as you type in the URL bar</li>
      <li>Queries you send to certain search engines</li>
      <li>Data about your web page interactions, such as mouse movements, scrolls, 
      and time spent</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Cliqz GmbH collects telemetry analytics, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Your interactions with specific fields and buttons in Cliqz. This data 
      is tied to a unique identifier allowing Cliqz GmbH to understand performance 
      over time</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Mozilla collects telemetry analytics, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Counts of visits to search engine pages and which search engines you use</li>
      <li>Cliqz’s unique identifier, which allows Mozilla to look for correlations 
      across Firefox and Cliqz telemetry systems</li>
    </ul>
