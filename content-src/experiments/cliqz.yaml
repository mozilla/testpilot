introduction: >
  Get search results faster, directly in the browser. Start typing and see suggestions
  from around the Web in real time, right below the URL bar. And because Cliqz avoids
  collecting personally identifiable data, or building user profiles, your results are
  more private.

privacy_preamble: >
  The Cliqz Test Pilot experiment is brought to you through collaboration
  between Cliqz GmbH, and Mozilla. Cliqz is designed to protect your privacy
  and avoid collecting sensitive information that can be used to create user
  profiles. However, anonymizing data like this is difficult, and it may
  still be possible to identify specific individuals.
measurements:
  - >
    Cliqz GmbH collects data about your search and browsing activity, including
    text as you type in the URL bar, queries you send to certain search
    engines, and data about your web page interactions, such as mouse
    movements, scrolls, and time spent.
  - >
    Cliqz GmbH collects telemetry analytics, including your interactions with
    specific fields and buttons in Cliqz. This data is tied to a unique
    identifier allowing Cliqz GmbH to understand performance over time.
  - >
    Mozilla collects telemetry analytics, including counts of visits to search
    engine pages and which search engines you use, and Cliqz’s unique
    identifier, which allows Mozilla to look for correlations across Firefox
    and Cliqz telemetry systems.
