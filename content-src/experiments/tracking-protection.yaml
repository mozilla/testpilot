  Will you help us make Tracking Protection better? This experiment turns on
  Tracking Protection for all browsing and offers a quick way to report any
  issues you see as you browse.
introduction: >
  <p>Until now, Tracking Protection in Firefox was only available in Private
    Browsing mode. This experiment enables Tracking Protection all the time!
    (Of course, you can disable it on a site-by-site basis whenever you want.)</p>
  <p>This experiment lets you help us understand where Tracking Protection breaks
    the Web so that we can improve it for all Firefox users. As you browse, click
    the purple shield icon in the URL bar at the top of the page to tell us which
    sites work well with Tracking Protection and which don't.</p>

measurements:
  - >
    Tracking Protection will prompt you for feedback when it blocks a
    tracker. We collect basic usage data when you engage with this prompt,
    such as when you enable or disable the trackers on the page or report a
    problem.
  - >
    When you engage with a prompt, we also collect information about the
    page you are on and the tracking domain that is being blocked. This helps
    us understand when and why you are experiencing a problem.
  - >
    Other than the domain, we don't collect any further information from the
    tracker, such as data about unique IDs that are used or cookies that are
    set.
  - >
    To identify trackers, we use a list provided by our partner Disconnect.
    You can read more about the standards Disconnect applies <a
