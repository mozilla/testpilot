  Will you help us make Tracking Protection better? This experiment turns on
  Tracking Protection for all browsing and offers a quick way to report any
  issues you see as you browse.
introduction: >
  <p>Until now, Tracking Protection in Firefox was only available in Private
    Browsing mode. This experiment enables Tracking Protection all the time!
    (Of course, you can disable it on a site-by-site basis whenever you want.)</p>
  <p>This experiment lets you help us understand where Tracking Protection breaks
    the Web so that we can improve it for all Firefox users. As you browse, click
    the purple shield icon in the URL bar at the top of the page to tell us which
    sites work well with Tracking Protection and which don't.</p>

measurements:
  - >
    Tracking Protection will prompt you for feedback when it blocks a
    tracker. We collect basic usage data when you engage with this prompt,
    such as when you enable or disable the trackers on the page or report a
    problem.
  - >
    When you engage with a prompt, we also collect information about the
    page you are on and the tracking domain that is being blocked. This helps
    us understand when and why you are experiencing a problem.
  - >
    Other than the domain, we don't collect any further information from the
    tracker, such as data about unique IDs that are used or cookies that are
    set.
  - >
    To identify trackers, we use a list provided by our partner Disconnect.

  <h3>Test Pilot Tracking Protection Graduation Report</h3>
  <p>The Tracking Protection feature in Private Browsing Mode is popular with Firefox users, 
  but it comes with a few downsides: it can break page layout and multimedia content on 
  websites, and it sometimes blocks content that isn’t tracking you. We’ve collected qualitative 
  evidence of this through user feedback, but since we introduced Tracking Protection, 
  we haven’t been able to quantify the impact of breakage and false positives on the overall 
  user experience.</p>
  <p>We launched the Tracking Protection experiment in Test Pilot with a goal of understanding
   how the block list we use for Tracking Protection in <a target="_blank" href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history">Private Browsing Mode</a> and in 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-privacy-browser/id1055677337?mt=8">Firefox Focus for iOS</a> 
   contributes to website breakage. The experiment was fairly 
   simple by design: we enabled Tracking Protection and let users disable it on specific sites 
   or provide reports about websites that seemed to break as a result of the experiment.</p>
  <p><strong>Here’s how it went down</strong></p>
  <p>The user interface for the Tracking Protection experiment was simple. When Tracking 
  Protection was enabled, users saw an icon in their browser’s URL bar. Clicking 
  the icon opened a panel where participants could report a problem and turn 
  Tracking Protection off for that domain.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>Participants had the option to give more details about the problems they saw.</p>
  <figure>
  <img src="/static/images/experiments/tracking-protection/experiments_experimentdetail/detail2.jpg" alt="Tracking Protection doorhanger" />
  </figure>
  <p>For this experiment, we only collected data when participants turned Tracking 
  Protection on or off, or when they reported problems with a particular domain. 
  We did not collect data on other browsing activity and we did not record full URLs.</p>
  <p><strong>Here’s what we learned</strong></p>
  <p>We hypothesized that users would frequently disable Tracking Protection on broken sites. 
  This, it turns out, was not the case. The chart below shows that despite a high 
  number of participants using Firefox Tracking Protection every day, Tracking 
  Protection was disabled on very few sites.</p>
  <figure>
  <img src="/static/images/experiments/tracking-protection/graduation/gr-001.png" width="100%" height="auto" />
  <figcaption>The number of times users disabled Tracking Protection was low to begin with,  and decreased over the life of the experiment.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Further, the rate at which users disabled Tracking Protection decreased as the 
  experiment progressed. We think that once users disabled Tracking Protection for 
  the most problematic sites, they didn’t encounter or weren’t bothered by breakage 
  to the point that they would disable it for additional sites they visited later in 
  the experiment.  Since we didn’t measure total page views, there are limits to what 
  we can conclude about the number of sites broken by Tracking protection. Nevertheless, 
  this data suggests that breakage may be less widespread than we initially believed, 
  and it’s worth digging deeper into more specific breakage data.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>We were also interested in the impact Google Analytics had on site breakage. 
  Google Analytics is a nearly ubiquitous service across the Web (full disclosure: 
    we use it to gather traffic data for testpilot.firefox.com) that is blocked by 
  Tracking Protection. When we began this experiment, some developers suggested that 
  how a site set up Google Analytics could have a large impact on breakage. Blocking 
  Google Analytics shouldn’t cause sites to break, but sometimes site developers write 
  code that ignores the possibility of Google Analytics being blocked. If developers 
  don’t accommodate for this possibility, broader failures in the way that code running 
  on sites can occur because scripts on the site make reference to code that is never loaded.</p>
  <p>It turns out that for the most part Google Analytics does not correlate to breakage. 
  In fact, while Google Analytics shows up frequently in our data, it only correlated 
  to breakage reports 25 percent of the time, which is low compared to breakage rates 
  reported for other trackers.</p>
  <p>Early on, we noticed that one service – Twimg, Twitter’s remote image hosting 
  service – consistently showed up as a source of reported breakage. By diving 
  into our user feedback, we figured out that this breakage caused images not to render 
  and often lead to broken layout. We communicated our findings to <a target="_blank" href="https://disconnect.me/">Disconnect</a> (the tracking 
    protection company that provides our block list), and they were able to re-categorize the 
  Twimg domain as a content provider, mitigating the breakage.</p>
  <p>In other cases when a known tracker caused site breakages, were less successful in 
  modifying the Tracking Protection experiment to improve user experience. For 
  example, we saw many reports of breakage linking video playback issues to Tealium, 
  a tracker that’s used for marketing analytics. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mozilla/blok/issues/216#issuecomment-266802796">We attempted to create a work around for this breakage</a> by using something called a shim – a fake initial reference to the 
  tracker code that would theoretically let sites continue to run as though it really existed 
  without breaking. Unfortunately, we found that while we could resolve the initial 
  error by faking references with a code shim, secondary errors would crop as sites tried 
  to execute code. Since these errors tended to be unique across different sites, we 
  determined our approach couldn’t account for every error and wouldn’t scale effectively.</p>
  <figure>
  <img src="/static/images/experiments/tracking-protection/graduation/gr-003.png" width="100%" height="auto" />
  <figcaption>Google Analytics is ubiquitous, but shows relative low reported correlated breakage. Meanwhile Twitter’s image service (pbs.twimg.com) is much smaller but shows much higher reported breakage. Tealium (tags.tiqcdn.com) was also a commonly reported source of breakage.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Here’s what happens next</strong></p>
  <p>What’s next for the Tracking Protection experiment? Now that we’ve announced 
  retirement plans for this add-on, we will no longer maintain it. If you have it 
  enabled, you don’t need to do anything. We’ll automatically uninstall it in the 
  coming days. Tracking Protection will continue as a feature of Private Browsing, however.</p>
  <p>The Tracking Protection reporting feature, unlike many Test Pilot experiments, 
  was never designed to graduate into Firefox. We created this experiment to learn 
  how Tracking Protection works in the wild. We also learned a lot about (and are 
    grateful for!) the willingness of our Test Pilot community to provide feedback.</p>
  <p>We intend to run more studies based on our initial results. We are launching 
  a similarly structured study in Test Pilot to learn about site performance in Firefox. 
  We’ll use similar feedback mechanisms as the Tracking Protection study to learn about 
  sites that cause Firefox users particular problems so we can address these issues 
  as we work on our next generation Web rendering engine. Look for this study in late February 2017.</p>
  <p>We will also conduct some messaging studies to help us understand how Firefox 
  users who aren’t in Test Pilot think about online tracking and how we can best 
  explain the costs and benefits of Tracking Protection and similar blocking services.</p>
  <p>Finally, we’re planning a follow-up Tracking Protection Study in Test Pilot 
  based on what we learned this go round. In the next round, we will be adding 
  more fine tuned user control, differential privacy, and an improved user interface. 
  We believe these additions will help us take the next step toward shipping Tracking 
  Protection in Firefox beyond Private Browsing Mode. Look for that study in late 2017.</p>
  <p>Thank you to all the Test Pilots who installed Tracking Protection and reported problems through the add-on!</p>
